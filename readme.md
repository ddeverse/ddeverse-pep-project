# Social Media Blog API

## Overview

**Social Media Blog API** is a backend RESTful API for a micro-blogging social media platform. It supports user account registration, login authentication, message posting, message editing, deletion, and retrieval (both globally and user-specific). This API provides all essential functionality to support a lightweight frontend client for a blogging or messaging app.

The project was designed following a **three-layer architecture** pattern (Controller â†’ Service â†’ DAO), using a relational database and JDBC for persistence.
